# Maths Tetris

## Overview
Maths Tetris is an educational game concept inspired by Tetris, designed to help children learn arithmetic operations in an interactive and engaging way. Players manipulate falling number blocks to form correct mathematical equations, which disappear upon successful completion. 

## Features
- **Falling Number Blocks**: Each block contains a random number (1-9) and drops from the top of the screen.
- **Player Controls**: Move blocks left, right, and down to arrange them.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Players must align number blocks to form valid equations (e.g., `2 × 3 × 2 = 12`).
- **Equation Matching**: If a correct result is formed, the blocks disappear, and points are awarded.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: As the game advances, blocks fall faster and require more complex calculations.
- **Multiple Stages**: The game includes different mathematical operations such as Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction, and Division.

## Controls
- **Left Arrow (←)**: Move the falling block left
- **Right Arrow (→)**: Move the falling block right
- **Down Arrow (↓)**: Speed up the falling block

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

### Running the Game
```sh
python maths_tetris.py
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional game modes for each arithmetic operation
- Introduce special blocks for bonuses and challenges
- Add score tracking and leaderboard
